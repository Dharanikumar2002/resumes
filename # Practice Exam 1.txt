    - Instead of defining permissions for individual IAM users, it's usually more convenient to create groups that relate to job functions (administrators, developers, accounting, etc.).
    - Next, define the relevant permissions for each group. Finally, assign IAM users to those groups. All the users in an IAM group inherit the permissions assigned to the group.
    - That way, you can make changes for everyone in a group in just one place. As people move around in your company, you can
    simply change what IAM group their IAM user belongs to.

39. Which of the following is an AWS Cloud architecture design principle?
    - A. Implement single points of failure.
    - B. Implement loose coupling.
    - C. Implement monolithic design.
    - D. Implement vertical scaling.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

    Correct Answer: B

    Explanation:
    - Loose coupling between services can also be done through asynchronous integration. It involves one component that generates events and another that consumes them.
    - The two components do not integrate through direct point-to-point interaction, but usually through an intermediate durable storage layer.
    - This approach decouples the two components and introduces additional resiliency.
    - So, for example, if a process that is reading messages from the queue fails, messages can still be added to the queue to be processed when the system recovers.

    - C. Create one IAM user and share with many developers and users.
    - D. Enable Amazon CloudFront.
    - E. Activate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged users.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

    Correct Answer: BE

    Explanation:
    - If you decided to create service accounts (that is, accounts used for programmatic access by applications running outside of the AWS environment) and generate access keys for them, you should create a dedicated service account for each use case.
    - This will allow you to restrict the associated policy to only the permissions needed for the particular use case, limiting the blast radius if the credentials are compromised.
    - For example, if a monitoring tool and a release management tool both require access to your AWS environment, create two separate service accounts with two separate policies that define the minimum set of permissions for each tool.

    - D. When an instance should not be stopped.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

    Correct Answer: A

    Explanation:

    - The key to understanding spot instances is to look at the way that cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) operate.
    - Cloud service providers invest in hardware resources and then release those resources (often on a per-hour basis) to subscribers.
    - One of the problems with this business model, however, is that at any given time, there are likely to be compute resources that are not being utilized.
    - These resources represent hardware capacity that AWS has paid for but are sitting idle, and not making AWS any money at the moment.
    - Rather than allowing these computing resources to go to waste, AWS offers them at a substantially discounted rate, with the understanding that if someone needs those resources for running a normal EC2 instance, that instance will take priority over spot instances that are using the hardware resources at a discounted rate.
    - In fact, spot instances will be stopped if the resources are needed elsewhere.

48. How does AWS charge for AWS Lambda?
    - A. Users bid on the maximum price they are willing to pay per hour.
    - B. Users choose a 1-, 3- or 5-year upfront payment term.
    - C. Users pay for the required permanent storage on a file system or in a database.
    - D. Users pay based on the number of requests and consumed compute resources.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

    Correct Answer: D

    Explanation:

    - AWS Lambda is charging its users by the number of requests for their functions and by the duration, which is the time the code needs to execute.
    - When code starts running in response to an event, AWS Lambda counts a request.
    - It will charge the total number of requests across all of the functions used.
    - Duration is calculated by the time when your code started executing until it returns or until it is terminated, rounded up near to 100ms.
    - The AWS Lambda pricing depends on the amount of memory that the user used to allocate to the function.

    - C. Provide DDoS protection with AWS Shield.
    - D. Use Amazon CloudFront to protect the Amazon EC2 instance.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

    Correct Answer: A

    Explanation:

    - AWS Security Groups act like a firewall for your Amazon EC2 instances controlling both inbound and outbound traffic.
    - When you launch an instance on Amazon EC2, you need to assign it to a particular security group.
    - After that, you can set up ports and protocols, which remain open for users and computers over the internet.
    - AWS Security Groups are very flexible. You can use the default security group and still customize it according to your liking (although we don't recommend this practice because groups should be named according to their purpose.) Or you can create a security group that you want for your specific applications.
    - To do this, you can write the corresponding code or use the Amazon EC2 console to make the process easier.

50. Which disaster recovery scenario offers the lowest probability of down time?
    - A. Backup and restore
    - B. Pilot light
    - C. Warm standby
    - D. Multi-site active-active

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

    Correct Answer: D

    Explanation:

    - Backup and Restore: a simple, straightforward, cost-effective method that backs up and restores data as needed.
    - Keep in mind that because none of your data is on standby, this method, while cheap, can be quite time-consuming.
    - Pilot Light: This method keeps critical applications and data at the ready so that it can be quickly retrieved if needed.
    - Warm Standby: This method keeps a duplicate version of your business' core elements running on standby at all times, which makes for a little downtime and an almost seamless transition.
    - Multi-Site Solution: Also known as a Hot Standby, this method fully replicates your company's data/ applications between two or more active locations and splits your traffic/usage between them.
    - If a disaster strikes, everything is simply rerouted to the unaffected area, which means you'll suffer almost zero downtime.
    - However, by running two separate environments simultaneously, you will obviously incur much higher costs.

    - A. Implement loose coupling.
    - B. Design for failure.
    - C. Automate everything that can be automated.
    - D. Use services, not servers.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

    Correct Answer: B

    Explanation:
    - Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads.
    - When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ).
    - Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable.
    - In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete.
    - Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

    Correct Answer: D

    Explanation:
    - Moving data to the cloud is not quite as simple as flipping a switch.
    - For companies that have managed their own data centers or server rooms for decades, there are a few steps to consider --and it's not always wise to pull the plug on an internal infrastructure quite so quickly.
    - If a startup uses on-premise business servers and then experiences unexpected growth, abandoning those servers doesn't make sense (even if the long-term plan is to do exactly that).
    - AWS Storage Gateway is a way to bridge this gap for companies of any size.
    - It's a hybrid storage option that connects on-premise storage including age-old tape backup systems to the cloud in a way that also provides one console to access all storage configurations.

    Correct Answer: C

    Explanation:
    - When your web traffic is geo-dispersed, it's not always feasible and certainly not cost effective to replicate your entire infrastructure across the globe.
    - A CDN provides you the ability to utilize its global network of edge locations to deliver a cached copy of web content such as videos, webpages, images and so on to your customers.
    - To reduce response time, the CDN utilizes the nearest edge location to the customer or originating request location in order to reduce the response time.
    - Throughput is dramatically increased given that the web assets are delivered from cache.
    - For dynamic data, many CDNs can be configured to retrieve data from the origin servers.
